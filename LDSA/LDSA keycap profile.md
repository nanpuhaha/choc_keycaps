_LDSA_ is a new Choc-compatible low-pro keycap profile by _Darryl_ from lowprokb.ca – with deeper dishes.

_Darryl_, designer of the **Corne-ish Zen** keyboard, announced his idea of a new keycap profile in January. His plan was essentially a low profile version of the **DSA** keycap (or uniform MT3): a spherical and uniform profile with deepened scoop and lengthened skirt "as much as possible."

> I want to produce something that is comfortable to type on, and looks a bit more traditional – Darryl.

According to _Darryl_, the dishes on these are deeper than any other commercially available keycap. And the finger pad that your finger touches is larger than that of MT3 and SA.

Actually, the dishes are close to the deep dish homing keys of **MT3** caps: 1.52mm vs 1.63mm.

Not going for a sculpted ergo set makes it easy to put these keycaps on any obscure physical layout.

Despite the deeper dish, **LDSA** (blue) is not much thicker compared to **MBK** (red). Otherwise they are identical in width and height so they fit Choc-spaced (17x18mm) PCBs:

> LDSA seems much larger because the skirt is 1.35mm longer. Definitely taller by a little bit, but probably only like half a mm – Darryl.

The molds and the first sample caps are ready, so after the initial renders there are already real comparison photos available, e.g. this one with a lonely MBK lost in the sea of freshly arrived LDSAs (click to enlarge):

How to grab those? Stay tuned for the upcoming presale which is slated to start April 24. They will be available at [lowprokb.ca](https://lowprokb.ca/) and can be shipped internationally. Edit: [Here you go](https://lowprokb.ca/products/ldsa-low-profile-blank-keycaps).

> Doing a little presale in a week or two for cheap to get the profile out there and see if people like it enough to go dual shot – Darryl.

Until then, here are some STLs if you want to print the caps and see if you like this profile. License reminder: these files are released under the Creative Commons, non-commercial license.
